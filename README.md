# Template
Simple template setup to get quickly started with a basic project. Folder structures are setup for src & dst folders with folders for audio, font, img, javascript, sass, & svg with an HTML page with the essential HTML tags. An additional HTML page is included, meta-tags.html that can be referenced for many useful meta tags. To ensure the folder structure was pushed to the git repository each folder has a *.placeholder* file  inside of it. After pulling the repo, running the clean command using NPM will remove all of the *.placeholder* files from the project & it's subdirectories.

# Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/mcbeav/Finder.css.git
